## Zodiac Signs

We implemented a constellation in virtual space by 3D modeling 12 constellations that divide the Sun's orbit called zodiac signs.

## Project intro

Users can see the zodiac sign at a glance in virtual space, and use the mouse and button to zoom in on the constellation they want with animation.

## Key feature

* View all zodiac signs

* Click each zodiac sign button or Input birthday

* Move to corresponding zodiac


## Library

* Three.js
*The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, cross-browser, general purpose 3D library. The current builds only include a WebGL renderer but WebGPU (experimental), SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.  

* Tween.js
*TweenJS is a simple tweening library for use in Javascript. It was developed to integrate well with the EaselJS library, but is not dependent on or specific to it (though it uses the same Ticker and Event classes by default). It supports tweening of both numeric object properties & CSS style properties.  

* TrackballController.js
*Captures pointer events on an element and translates them to trackball-like motion.
